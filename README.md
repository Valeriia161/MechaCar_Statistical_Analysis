# `MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis `


 ## `Project Overview ` <br/>
AutosRUs’ newest prototype, the MechaCar, is suffering from production troubles that are blocking the manufacturing team’s progress. <br/>
The purpose of MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis is to review the production data for insights that may help the manufacturing team. <br/>
In this challenge, I helped the data analytics team with following: <br/>
•	Performing multiple linear regression analysis to identify which variables in the dataset predict the mpg of MechaCar prototypes; <br/>
•	Collecting summary statistics on the pounds per square inch (PSI) of the suspension coils from the manufacturing lots; <br/>
•	Running t-tests to determine if the manufacturing lots are statistically different from the mean population; <br/>
•	Designing a statistical study to compare vehicle performance of the MechaCar vehicles against vehicles from other manufacturers. <br/>
Also I wrote a summary interpretation of the findings for each statistical analysis.  <br/>

# `Summary ` <br/>
## 1.  Linear Regression to Predict MPG. 
Using my knowledge of R, I designed a linear model that predicts the mpg of MechaCar prototypes using several variables from the MechaCar_mpg.csv file.

## 2. Summary Statistics on Suspension Coil. <br/>
Using my knowledge of R, I created a summary statistics table to show: <br/>
•	The suspension coil’s PSI continuous variable across all manufacturing lots. <br/>

•	The following PSI metrics for each lot: mean, median, variance, and standard deviation. <br/>

## 3. T-Tests on Suspension Coils.
Using my knowledge of R, I performed t-tests to determine if all manufacturing lots and each lot individually are statistically different from the population mean of 1,500 pounds per square inch. <br/>
